    "Modificar el código del juego Pong contruido a través de OpenCV de tal manera que:\n",
    "1. Se muestre un marcador con 3 números. El primero indica el record, el segundo cuantas veces ha rebotado la bola en la barra y el tercero el número de veces que la bola a tocado el suelo. Si la bola toca el suelo, el marcador de los rebotes debe volver a 0.\n",
    "2. Cuando la bola toque el suelo debe actualizar el marcador, volver a aparecer en otro sitio aleatorio y esperar durante 5 segundos antes de volver a moverse. Esta cuenta atrás deberá mostrarse en pantalla.\n",
    "3. A medida que el marcador de rebotes aumenta, la velocidad de la bola debe hacerlo también, pero lentamente.\n",
    "4. Modifica el código para que la barra se mueva con el desplazamiento de alguna parte de tu cuerpo que detecte desde la webcam."
